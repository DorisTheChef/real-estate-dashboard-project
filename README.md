# Real Estate Dashboard Project
# CRMLS Market Analytics

## Overview

This project is part of the IDX Exchange Data Analyst Internship Program. The objective is to analyze California real estate market trends using CRMLS (California Regional Multiple Listing Service) data and develop automated reporting workflows and interactive Tableau dashboards.

The project focuses on understanding the complete analytics pipeline, from data acquisition and preparation to visualization and reporting.

## Current Progress

### Week 0

* Reviewed the IDX Exchange internship handbook and Week 0 requirements
* Downloaded CRMLS monthly listing and sold CSV files from the provided FTP source
* Reviewed the monthly CRMLS file naming pattern:
  * `CRMLSListingYYYYMM.csv`
  * `CRMLSSoldYYYYMM.csv`
* Reviewed API extraction scripts for listing and sold data

### Week 1

* Built a monthly concatenation workflow in `python/combine_crmls_monthly.py`
* Combined listing and sold CSVs from January 2024 through June 2026
* Preferred `_filled.csv` files when available and dropped the two extra filled columns
* Filtered both combined datasets to `PropertyType == "Residential"`
* Saved combined residential listing and sold datasets to `data/processed/`

### Weeks 2-3

* Created EDA notebooks for sold and listing datasets:
  * `notebooks/week2_3_sold_eda.ipynb`
  * `notebooks/week2_3_listing_eda.ipynb`
* Reviewed dataset shape, column data types, property types, and missing values
* Flagged columns with more than 90% missing values
* Created numeric summaries and outlier checks for key fields such as price, living area, bedrooms, bathrooms, days on market, and year built
* Answered EDA questions about property type share, close prices, days on market, sale-to-list outcomes, date consistency, and county median prices
* Enriched listing and sold datasets with monthly 30-year fixed mortgage rates from FRED using `python/enrich_mortgage_rates.py`
* Created `notebooks/mortgage_rate_vs_sales_volume.ipynb` to explore the relationship between mortgage rates and residential sold volume

### Weeks 4-5

* Created `python/week4_5_clean_sold_data.py` to prepare an analysis-ready sold dataset
* Converted date fields and numeric fields to analysis-friendly data types
* Dropped columns with more than 90% missing values
* Dropped unnecessary metadata fields while retaining fields useful for Market Analysis and Competitive Analysis
* Added invalid numeric, date consistency, and geographic quality flag columns
* Saved the cleaned sold dataset and cleaning summary reports to local `data/` folders
